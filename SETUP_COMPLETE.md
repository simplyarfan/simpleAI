## 🚀 How to Use This Setup

### Daily Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Start on test branch
git checkout test
git pull origin test

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Test locally
cd backend && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm run dev

# 4. Commit and push to test
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push origin test

# 5. Test on preview URLs
# Check Vercel and Netlify dashboards

# 6. When verified, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge test
git push origin main
```

### Using the Helper Script:

```bash
# Interactive mode
./switch-branch.sh

# Direct mode
./switch-branch.sh test   # Switch to test
./switch-branch.sh main   # Switch to main
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Test Locally

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Expected: Server starts without errors
```

### Step 2: Check Logs

```bash
# View logs in real-time
tail -f backend/logs/combined.log

# Make some requests and verify logging works
```

### Step 3: Test Security Features

```bash
# Test rate limiting (run 6 times quickly)
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"wrong"}'
done

# Expected: 6th request returns 429 (rate limited)
```

### Step 4: Test in Browser

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Login
5. Check response headers - should see security headers

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before merging to main, verify:

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend starts without errors
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Dashboard loads
- [ ] All existing features work
- [ ] Logs are being created
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] Rate limiting works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Preview deployments successful

---

## 🔄 Current Git Status

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch
# Output: * test

# Check commits
git log --oneline -5
# Output:
# 5a1a726 docs: add testing checklist and quick start guide
# b722680 feat: add security hardening - headers, logging, rate limiting
# 2eb50cd backup: save current state before creating test branch
```

## 📊 What Changed in Code

### server.js
```javascript
// Added security imports
const { securityHeaders, cors, securityLogger } = require('./middleware/security');
const logger = require('./utils/logger');

// Applied security middleware
app.use(securityHeaders);
app.use(securityLogger);

// Enhanced request logging with timing
```

### New Middleware (security.js)
- Security headers configuration
- Rate limiting setup
- CORS configuration
- Security event logging
- Suspicious activity detection

### New Logger (logger.js)
- Winston configuration
- File rotation
- Error tracking
- Request/response logging
- Security event logging

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Thoroughly (Recommended)

1. **Test locally** (15 minutes)
   - Start backend and frontend
   - Test all features
   - Check logs
   - Verify security features

2. **Test on preview** (10 minutes)
   - Push to test branch (already done)
   - Check Vercel preview
   - Check Netlify preview
   - Test on preview URLs

3. **Merge to main** (2 minutes)
   - If all tests pass
   - Merge test to main
   - Monitor production

### Option 2: Merge Immediately (If Confident)

```bash
git checkout main
git merge test
git push origin main
```

**⚠️ Only do this if you're confident everything works!**
