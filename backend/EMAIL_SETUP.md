# Email Service Configuration Guide

## Problem
The registration flow is failing because email verification codes cannot be sent. The backend logs show:
```
‚ùå [EMAIL] CRITICAL: Email credentials not configured
‚ùå [EMAIL] Set EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in Vercel environment variables
‚ùå [EMAIL] Email sending will FAIL until credentials are added
```

## Solution: Configure Gmail SMTP for Vercel

### Step 1: Generate Gmail App Password

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account (if not already enabled):
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable "2-Step Verification"

2. **Create an App Password**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Enter name: "Enterprise AI Hub Backend"
   - Click "Generate"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. **Go to your Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `thesimpleai` (or your backend project)

2. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add the following variables:

   | Variable Name | Value | Environment |
   |--------------|-------|-------------|
   | `EMAIL_USER` | `your-email@securemaxtech.com` | Production, Preview, Development |
   | `EMAIL_PASS` | `your-16-char-app-password` | Production, Preview, Development |
   | `EMAIL_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` | Production, Preview, Development |
   | `EMAIL_PORT` | `587` | Production, Preview, Development |

   **Example values:**
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=admin@securemaxtech.com
   EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop  # (16 characters from Gmail App Password)
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   ```

3. **Save and Redeploy**:
   - After adding variables, redeploy your application
   - Go to: Deployments ‚Üí Click "..." on latest deployment ‚Üí "Redeploy"
   - OR push a new commit to trigger deployment

### Step 3: Verify Email Service

After redeployment, check the Vercel logs:

‚úÖ **Success logs should show:**
```
‚úÖ [EMAIL] SMTP transporter created successfully
‚úÖ [EMAIL] Using: admin@securemaxtech.com
```

‚ùå **If still failing:**
```
‚ùå [EMAIL] CRITICAL: Email credentials not configured
```
‚Üí Variables not set correctly, check Vercel dashboard

### Step 4: Test Registration Flow

1. Try registering a new user at: https://thesimpleai.netlify.app/auth/register
2. Check Vercel logs for email sending confirmation:
   ```
   üìß [EMAIL] Attempting to send verification code to: user@securemaxtech.com
   ‚úÖ [EMAIL] Verification code sent successfully
   ```
3. Check your email inbox for the verification code

## Alternative: Use a Different Email Provider

### Option 1: Gmail (Recommended for Development)
- **Pros**: Easy setup, reliable
- **Cons**: Daily sending limits (500 emails/day), requires App Password

### Option 2: SendGrid (Recommended for Production)
- **Pros**: High deliverability, 100 emails/day free tier, professional service
- **Setup**:
  1. Sign up: https://sendgrid.com/
  2. Create API Key: Settings ‚Üí API Keys
  3. Update Vercel variables:
     ```bash
     EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
     EMAIL_PORT=587
     EMAIL_USER=apikey
     EMAIL_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key
     ```

### Option 3: AWS SES (Recommended for Scale)
- **Pros**: Lowest cost at scale ($0.10 per 1000 emails), high deliverability
- **Cons**: Requires AWS account, more complex setup

### Option 4: Mailgun
- **Pros**: Developer-friendly, generous free tier (5000 emails/month)
- **Setup**: Similar to SendGrid

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid login" or "Authentication failed"
**Cause**: Incorrect email or password
**Fix**: 
- Verify EMAIL_USER is correct
- Regenerate Gmail App Password
- Ensure no spaces in password (Vercel might trim values)

### Issue: "Connection timeout"
**Cause**: Firewall or port blocking
**Fix**:
- Verify EMAIL_PORT is 587 (TLS)
- Try port 465 (SSL) if 587 fails
- Check Vercel's serverless function timeout

### Issue: "Transporter not initialized"
**Cause**: Environment variables not loaded
**Fix**:
- Verify variables are set for correct environment (Production/Preview)
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check Vercel logs for "‚ùå [EMAIL] CRITICAL: Email credentials not configured"

### Issue: Emails sent but not received
**Cause**: Spam filtering
**Fix**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Add sender to contacts
- For production: Set up SPF/DKIM records for your domain

## Current Backend Behavior (After Fix)

### ‚úÖ GOOD: Registration fails gracefully if email cannot be sent
```javascript
// Backend now:
1. Creates user in database
2. Attempts to send verification email
3. If email fails ‚Üí Deletes user and returns error
4. If email succeeds ‚Üí Returns success with userId
```

### ‚úÖ GOOD: Frontend handles errors correctly
```javascript
// Frontend now:
1. Calls registration API
2. If response.ok is false ‚Üí Shows error, stays on page
3. If response.ok is true ‚Üí Redirects to verification page
```

### ‚ùå BAD: Old behavior (fixed)
```javascript
// Old backend (wrong):
1. Created user
2. Returned success immediately
3. Tried to send email in background
4. If email failed ‚Üí User created but no verification email!
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials to git**
   - Use `.env` locally
   - Use Vercel environment variables in production

2. **Use App Passwords, not real passwords**
   - Never use your actual Gmail password
   - Regenerate App Password if compromised

3. **Monitor email sending**
   - Check Vercel logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for email failures

4. **Consider dedicated email service for production**
   - Gmail is OK for development/testing
   - Use SendGrid/AWS SES/Mailgun for production scale

## Quick Reference

### Local Development (.env)
```bash
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@securemaxtech.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
```

### Vercel Environment Variables
```bash
# Navigate to:
https://vercel.com/[your-username]/[project-name]/settings/environment-variables

# Add all four variables for all environments
```

### Test Email Sending
```bash
# Check backend logs in Vercel:
https://vercel.com/[your-username]/[project-name]/logs

# Look for:
‚úÖ [EMAIL] SMTP transporter created successfully
‚úÖ [EMAIL] Verification code sent successfully
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Generate Gmail App Password
2. ‚úÖ Add environment variables to Vercel
3. ‚úÖ Redeploy backend
4. ‚úÖ Test registration flow
5. ‚úÖ Monitor logs for email confirmation
6. üîÑ (Optional) Migrate to SendGrid/SES for production
