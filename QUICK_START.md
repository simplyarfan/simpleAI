# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Test Branch Workflow

## What We Just Set Up

✅ **Test Branch Created** - Safe place to test changes  
✅ **Security Improvements Added** - Headers, logging, monitoring  
✅ **Workflow Documentation** - How to work with branches  
✅ **Testing Checklist** - What to verify before going live

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Test Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
# Make sure you're on test branch
git branch
# Should show: * test

# Install new dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Start backend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Auth routes loaded successfully
✅ CV Intelligence routes loaded successfully
✅ Server running on port 5000
```

**If you see errors:**
- Check that all dependencies installed
- Make sure `.env` file exists
- Verify database connection

### Step 2: Test in Browser (5 minutes)

```bash
# In a new terminal, start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Then test:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Try logging in
3. Check browser console (F12) - should be no errors
4. Navigate to dashboard
5. Try creating a support ticket

**What to look for:**
- ✅ No red errors in console
- ✅ Login works
- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ✅ All features work as before

### Step 3: Check the Logs (2 minutes)

```bash
# Check if logs are being created
ls -la backend/logs/

# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f backend/logs/combined.log
```

**Make some requests and verify:**
- ✅ Requests are being logged
- ✅ Response times are shown
- ✅ No errors in logs

---

## ✅ If Everything Works Locally

### Option A: Deploy to Test Preview (Recommended)

```bash
# Commit any additional changes
git add .
git commit -m "test: verified security changes work locally"
git push origin test
```

**Then:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard - check test branch deployment
2. Go to Netlify dashboard - check test branch deployment
3. Test on preview URLs
4. If all good → proceed to merge

### Option B: Merge to Main Immediately

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge test
git merge test

# Push to production
git push origin main
```

**⚠️ Only do this if you're confident everything works!**

## 🔄 Daily Workflow Going Forward

### Starting Work:
```bash
# Always start on test branch
git checkout test
git pull origin test
```

### Making Changes:
```bash
# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Test locally
npm run dev

# Commit and push to test
git add .
git commit -m "description of changes"
git push origin test
```

### Going to Production:
```bash
# Only when test branch is verified
git checkout main
git merge test
git push origin main
```

---

## 🆘 Quick Commands

### Check which branch you're on:
```bash
git branch
```

### Switch to test branch:
```bash
git checkout test
```

### Switch to main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```

### See what changed:
```bash
git status
```

### Use the helper script:
```bash
./switch-branch.sh
# Follow the prompts
```

## 🎯 What's Different Now?

### Before:
```
main branch → changes → push → LIVE (risky!)
```

### Now:
```
test branch → changes → test → verify → merge to main → LIVE (safe!)
```

## ✨ New Features Added

1. **Security Headers**
   - Protection against XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing
   - Content Security Policy
   - HSTS for HTTPS enforcement

2. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Request/response timing
   - Error tracking
   - Security event logging
   - Rotating log files

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevents brute force attacks
   - Configurable limits per endpoint
   - IP-based tracking

4. **Security Monitoring**
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - SQL injection attempt logging
   - XSS attempt logging

## 🚨 Important Notes

### DO:
- ✅ Always work on test branch
- ✅ Test locally before pushing
- ✅ Test on preview URLs before merging
- ✅ Keep commits small and focused

### DON'T:
- ❌ Push directly to main (unless emergency)
- ❌ Merge without testing
- ❌ Commit without clear message
- ❌ Skip the testing checklist

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Git Basics:
- `git status` - See what's changed
- `git branch` - See all branches
- `git log` - See commit history
- `git diff` - See exact changes

### Testing:
- Browser console (F12) - Check for errors
- Network tab - Check API calls

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

**"I'm on the wrong branch!"**
```bash
git stash          # Save your changes
git checkout test  # Switch to test
git stash pop      # Get your changes back
```

**"I have merge conflicts!"**
```bash
# Git will mark conflicts in files
# Edit the files, remove the markers
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "resolved conflicts"
```

**"Something broke!"**
```bash
# Reset to last working state
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Start over on test branch
```

---

## ✅ Ready to Start?

### Your First Task:

1. **Test the current changes:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **If it works:**
